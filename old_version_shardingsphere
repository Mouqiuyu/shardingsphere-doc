-SharingSphere integrates SEATA, as it provides an automatic transaction mode(AT) to automatically generate compensation operations. As shown in the grey box of Figure 7, SEATA has three roles: 1) The Transaction Coordinator(TC) maintains the state of global and branch transactions and drives global commits or rollbacks; 2)The Transaction Manager(TM) defines the scope of global transactions; 3)Resource Manager(RM) manages resources and drive branch transactions to commit or rollback.

 The user application only needs to interact with ShardingSphere with a standard database connection. The BASE transaction in ShardingSphere is a 2PC process where ShardingSphere plays the role of TM and RM in SEATA. the BASE transaction process is shown in Figure 8.

 | Distributed Transaction | Transactional capability is key to ensuring database integrity and security and is also one of the databases' core technologies. With a hybrid engine based on XA and BASE transactions, ShardingSphere provides distributed transaction capabilities on top of standalone databases, enabling data security across underlying data sources. |
 | Read/write Splitting    | Read/write splitting can be used to cope with business access with high stress. ShardingSphere provides flexible read/write splitting capabilities and can achieve read access load balancing based on the understanding of SQL semantics and the ability to perceive the underlying database topology. |
 | High Availability       | High availability is a basic requirement for a data storage and computing platform. Guarantee the HA of your distributed database cluster with ShardingSphere’s Operator on Kubernetes, and the native HA of your existing data sources. |
-| Data Migration          | Data migration is the key to connecting data ecosystems. SharingSphere provides migration capabilities to help users migrate the data from other data sources, while simultaneously performing data sharding. |
